# Coding-Quiz-Rebecca-Chiquete

Hi grader, so its 12/7/2020 at 9pm and I just found out what I was supposed to write in the readme. Up until now I didnt know what to put in here. This read me wont be right this time but moving forward I will do it correctly. I also didnt realize that I needed to make multiple pushes to github. I have been working on the file and keeping my computer open on autosave mode. I talked to one of my classmates and they said everytime I finish a section I should upload it. I will do that from now on. 

This was super hard, I am having a hard time naming variables, and making sure that they are not too close to other variable names. I am having a hard time where I am getting stuck on making something in HTML a capital and then in JS making it not capital and then realizing that 3 hours later is the reason my code is not working. 

I am absolutly horrible at CSS, I just need to learn the wording and what it looks like so next time I can use it. I bough a book on it so hopefully that will help. 

It took me a total of 23 hours to get to where I am today. I have the text explaining, then the question to prompt and go to next page. I had a hard time when i put "You got it" on its own screen. It looks horrible on the same page as the question. I know with time I will figure that out. I also took about 5 hours to get the timer to work. That was difficult. Then with the function to make the finalPage show I lost my mind. All the variables in my head mushed together and I just had a rough time. 

I didnt have enough time to finish the assignment, but I did as much as I could while keeping my sanity. I got to the final page but I was not able to get the names stored, along with the score to show the high score. 

I know this will take time! Thanks for reading my rant.
